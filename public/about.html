            <p>I am a graduate from Virginia Tech with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I got my start in the technology field during my Sophmore year of high school,
                when I took an elective Computer Science course with an amazing teacher who ignited my passion for software development. As I worked to aquire my degree, I became
            proficient in a variety of languages. My main languages are Java and C, but I have experience in Python, C#, JavaScript, and Swift as well. I also took classes focusing
        on the Design aspect of development, where I learned to work in an Agile team environment and discovered my love for collaboration. Since graduating I have been continuing to
    develop my skills indenpendently and began the FastTrack program in November where I have further enhanced my Java knowledge, worked with Spring frameworks, and began learning Angular. </p>
