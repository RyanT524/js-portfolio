            <p class="p-project">Implemented a RESTful API using Spring Boot, JPA, and Postgresql that resembles the conceptual model of Twitter. Created a variety
                of endpoints using Spring services and controllers to handle requests, perform validation and business logic, and to transform data 
                between the API and database models. Completed as a team of 3.

            <p class="p-project">Uses a given ChessFaker class that manages all chess logic to perform three main tasks; 
                find the fastest win state given a starting board, 
                print the tree of all possible moves to a certain depth from a starting board, 
                and determine if a target board can be reached given a starting board and a depth.
                Completed through pair-programming with a partner.

            <p class="p-project"> Created a Virtual Reality experience using the Unity game engine to simulate cycling in a 3D environment. Worked on a team of 6 following
                Agile design methodologies. Primarily did scripting work in C# to handle path generation and bike speed in addition to implementing UI functionality. Did design, 
                prototyping, implementation, and finally evaluation by conducting user tests with the finished product.
